I strongly believe that wireframes are the best tool to help implement our code. When I was finishing my recipe, I was very inefficient without wireframes, because I needed to build the finished picture of the recipe in my mind while imagining the code, which caused me to forget what kind of code I should write midway. When I finish drawing the wireframe on paper, I can follow my thoughts and conceive the logic of my code step by step. I don't need to be distracted by imagining the pages of the website. I also like to show my drafts to others and get feedback. Sometimes my ideas are not the best, and the designer's ideas are not the most important. The most important thing is the client's idea. User design is the cornerstone of the products we create.
