My final project will continue building my profolio website. 
In my final project proposal slides, I add my inspiration website. My goal is to create a slideshow by using bootstrap. 
The slideshow will be my About page. Each slide will navigate audience to different page. 
I will also add some interactive elements. For example, I can add a search bar bu using JavaScript. This could help people to directly find their target.
In my game page, I might add a survey to help audience to target the type of games they like. 
At my contact pae, I might add the survey to see if people like my webstie or not.
If I have enough time, I will add some animation elements such as moving title or moving background.
