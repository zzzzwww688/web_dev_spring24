                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Mapo tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan province known for its fiery bright red sauce. 
                    The classic recipe is made with simmered silken tofu flavored with ground pork or beef, 
                    fermented bean paste (douban and douchi), chili oil, and Sichuan peppercorns. 
                    The dish is spicy, aromatic, deeply flavorful, and has a unique numbing character imparted from the Sichuan peppercorns.
                    While the Sichuan-style mapo tofu is known for its boldness and intensity, 
                    the Japanese version has a milder character as it has been adapted to the Japanese palate. 
                    Nevertheless, Japanese mapo tofu is still packed with lots of umamiâ€” thanks to the layering of flavors. 
                    Also, the spice level is tamed.

                                Give everything a final mix and remove from the heat immediately.

                <h3 id="serving">How to serve mapo tofu</h3>
                <p>For a quick lunch, simply pour it over plain steamed rice. 
                  Serving it with noodles is also a good choice(love how the sauce clings onto the noodle strands).
                  Or, include it in a multi-dish dinner. Pair it with other savoury protein or vegetable dishes. 
                  Take what we had last Saturday for example: Mapo tofu, steamed chicken, smashed cucumber, hot and sour soup and jasmine rice.
