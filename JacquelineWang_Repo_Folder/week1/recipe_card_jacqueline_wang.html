        <h2 id="introduction"> Mapo Tofu</h2>
        <p>
            Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐, ma po dou fu) is one of the most popular dishes from Sichuan cuisine. 
            The name of the dish roughly translates to “pockmarked grandma’s tofu.” The tofu pieces are braised in a rich spicy,
            and savory sauce along with fresh garlic and scallions, with a small amount of ground pork to enhance the flavor.
            The dish is so appetizing and it goes perfectly with steamed rice.

                        While waiting, mix some cornstarch with cold water in a small bowl. When time is up, lower the heat to medium. Pour in half of the mixture (make sure to stir it well beforehand). 
                        Leave to simmer for 10 seconds or so, then pour in the other half.

                        Gently stir to evenly distribute the thickening agent. Once the sauce becomes just thick enough to coat your spatula, add ground Sichuan pepper and sprinkle chopped scallions over. 
                        Give everything a final mix and remove from the heat immediately.

        <h3 id="serving">How to serve mapo tofu</h3>
        <p>For a quick lunch, simply pour it over plain steamed rice. 
           Serving it with noodles is also a good choice(love how the sauce clings onto the noodle strands).
           Or, include it in a multi-dish dinner. Pair it with other savoury protein or vegetable dishes. 
           Take what we had last Saturday for example: Mapo tofu, steamed chicken, smashed cucumber, hot and sour soup and jasmine rice.
